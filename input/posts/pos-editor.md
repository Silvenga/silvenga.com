Title: POS Editor

Not so common anymore, but POS displays could be seen in every store. I made a small C# program that could interact with one of these displays through the COM port and show preconfigured text to the user. I know nothing about compatiblity with other vender models, but it work with my model and it was useful. Hopefully someone else could find this project useful as well.
