title: Bad Sony XAV-9500ES Screws
description: The size of XAV-9500ES screws, soon to be replaced.

I have a Sony XAV-9500ES unit in my aging car. It's mostly great, adding much needed Android Auto support. My main complaint is that it tends to rattle over time as the screws self-loosen from normal vibrations - requiring continuous tightening.

My plan is to thread-lock them, but while I'm at that, I'm replacing them with Torx as they are completely stripped at this point (soft metal).

The one on the left is a M4 x 5mm PH3, pan-head. The right one is a M4 x 6mm PH3, flat-head, 45 degrees.
