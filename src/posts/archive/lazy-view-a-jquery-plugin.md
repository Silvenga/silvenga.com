I hate slow websites. A month or so ago I had to log onto Delta.com. I was largely unimpressed with the speed in which it loaded. I could wait for seconds until text would appear. I would wait even longer for the site to become responsive.

This is what I hate about browsing the Internet. A user should not have to wait for a page to download. So I made it my life mission to optimise this blog. I am currently averaging 600ms from start to ready. This is largely impressive (top 5% of load times) for a dynamic site such as my own.

I've gotten to the point on this blog's design that I cannot make loading any faster. My next step is to make loading appear faster to the user.

This lead me to create a jQuery plugin that I call Lazy View. With this plugin, elements will fade into view as the user moves around the page.
