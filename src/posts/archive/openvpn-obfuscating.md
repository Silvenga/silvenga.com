## Server (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)

`obfsproxy` is included in the default Ubuntu Trusty repos now (although a bit out of date). It contains the pluggable transport `obfs3`.  
```bash
apt-get install obfsproxy

# Default OVPN port: 1194
# Obfs3 port: 8443

obfsproxy --log-file obfs.log --log-min-severity=info obfs3 --dest=127.0.0.1:1194 server 0.0.0.0:8443
```

## Client (Windows 8.1)

There isn't any recent packages for Windows, but thankfully the binaries are included by default in the `Tor Browser Bundle` (which I ripped from).
